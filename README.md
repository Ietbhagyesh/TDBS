    Temple Darshan Booking System is the website made to simplify the experience of temple darshan.

     Our prime objective is to reduce waiting time of devotee standing in a queue & provide assistance to temple staff in temple management.
     Our project, the Temple Darshan Booking System, is a comprehensive online solution developed using Java web-based technologies.
     It aims to streamline and automate various processes such as queue management for devotees, managing offerings, managing events and poojas.
